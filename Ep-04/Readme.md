props are just normal function arguments.
passing a props to a function is same as passing an argument to a function
props are objects.
config driven ui- the ui driven by config(api)
always uses key while using map
if we are not using key then suppose new card is coming then react trat as a same card so it will render the whole component
by giving th key we can optimize the performance
we can index as a key also
not using keys(not acceptable) <<<<< index as key <<<<<< unique id (best practices)
